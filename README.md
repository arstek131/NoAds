# NoAds
Powerful .NET program to blocking unwanted connections with a hosts File

## How it's made?
Written in C# using windows forms.

## What it does?
You can use a modified HOSTS file to block ads, banners, 3rd party Cookies, 3rd party page counters, web bugs, and even most hijackers and possibly unwanted programs. This is accomplished by blocking the connection(s) that supplies these little gems.

## Compatibility
Should work fine with every windows based system, other systems aren't supported at the moment

## Credits
Thanks to [mvps](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/) for providing a updated hosts file

### Notes
Make sure to backup your host file first, located at `Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
